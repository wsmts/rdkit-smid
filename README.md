# rdkit-smid
Docker image for calculating the *smallest maximum intramolecular distance* (SMID) value of a molecule as described in [J. Chem. Inf. Model. 2020, 60, 4, 2091â€“2099](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.9b00692)

The code was based [smid.py / github](https://github.com/BrianGoldman/SMID/blob/master/smid.py), and adapted to use the rdkit toolkit instead of the openeye toolkit.

# Usage
The notebook can run in a conda environment or in a docker container.
